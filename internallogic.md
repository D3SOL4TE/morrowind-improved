# INTERNAL LOGIC

- [**Corprus Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45544) by grasscid: gives you the disease resisting effects of Corprus as soon as you catch it from Dagoth Gares rather than after Divayth Fyr cures you, as according to the lore.

- [**FMI - Athyn and Shardie**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47322) by PoodleSandwich: makes Athyn Sarethi and Shardie's appearances more closely match what is inferred from the in-game book "The Hope of the Redoran".
- [**FMI - Hospitality Papers Expanded**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46107) by quorn, PoodleSandwich, Jeff Baker, and SuperQuail: expands quorn's HospitalityPapers Mod, including newly recorded lines from original Morrowind voice actor Jeff Baker.

- [**FMI - NotAllDunmer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47569) by PoodleSandwich: not all Dunmer are slavers. Not all Argonians are slaves. Idle dialogue filtering has been improved to reflect this.

- [**King's Oath Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43284) by R-Zero: in-game dialogues and journal entries suggested that some exceptional members of Royal Guard wield King's Oath blades, but that wasn't the case. This plugin adds King's Oath to Helseth's personal guards (the ones in the throne room, except Tienius Delitian and Karrod).
- [**LDM -  Immersive Crassius Curio Greetings**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47284) by Lucevar: Crassius Curio will now have more positive / flirtatious hello lines when you're naked.
- [**LDM - Abolitionists**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47499) by Lucevar: refilters and adds on to vanilla dialogue about abolitionists, so that plantation and mine owners who make their money off slavery don't give the same line as other Hlaalu, who are more ambivalent about the practice. 
- [**LDM - Balmora Rumour Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47455) by Lucevar: adds an option to refuse Larrius Varro's Bloodbath quest, and edits the filtering on vanilla Balmora rumours so that they don't get overwritten by the Varro rumours. 16+ rumours now appear!

- [**Outfit Greetings Tweaked**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46066?) by Anille: greetings regarding clothes are now limited to clothiers, nobles and snooty High Elves.
- [**Quarantined Vvardenfell**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47335) by Gavrilo93: as Asciene Rene's dialogue suggests, you won't be allowed to travel to Mournhold if you have a disease now. 
- [**Redaynia Restored**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47646) by R-Zero: there are several mentions of a fishing village at the site of Ald Redaynia in both in-game dialogue and books. This mod adds the missing village of Ald Redaynia. 
- [**Redoran Freeloaders**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47321) by Gavrilo93: if you are a Redoran, you can rent a room at the Flowers of Gold in Vivec for free, as the dialogue suggests.

- [**Sheep-no-More**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45168) by McChuggernaut: removes the sheep sounds from Morrowind.
- [**Talos Cult Revised - G93's Version**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47571) by Gavrilo93: improves the Talos Cult shrine in the Gnisis legion barracks in an attempt to give a more interesting depiction of the cult.
- [**The Dream is the Door**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47423) by Melchior Dahrk: to align with what the in-game dialogue suggests, the entrance to the Cavern of the Incarnate will now only be visible during the magical hours of twilight. 
- [**The Madstone**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47653) by Melchior Dahrk: makes the Madstone work as described on the lore, adds a new model to the Madstone, and expands on in-game dialogue.
- [**Thickle-Lo - The Succulent Hackle-Lo Mod**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47502) by Melchior Dahrk: makes Hackle-lo leaves thicker as described in-game ("succulent").
- [**True Scourge**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43294/) by R-Zero: makes the Scourge artifact behave more like its description in the game books. Now any summoned Daedra hit by this weapon gets instantly banished back to Oblivion.

    - NPC - **severa magia**.
