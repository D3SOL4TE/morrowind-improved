# INTERNAL LOGIC

- [**Corprus Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45544) by grasscid: gives you the disease resisting effects of Corprus as soon as you catch it from Dagoth Gares rather than after Divayth Fyr cures you, as according to the lore.

- [**FMI - Athyn and Shardie**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47322) by PoodleSandwich: makes Athyn Sarethi and Shardie's appearances more closely match what is inferred from the in-game book "The Hope of the Redoran".

  - Install both main files.
- [**FMI - Nice to Meet You**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47329) by PoodleSandwich: NPCs no longer will greet you as if they had just met you.
- [**FMI - NotAllDunmer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47569) by PoodleSandwich: not all Dunmer are slavers. Not all Argonians are slaves. Idle dialogue filtering has been improved to reflect this.

- [**King's Oath Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43284) by R-Zero: in-game dialogues and journal entries suggested that some exceptional members of Royal Guard wield King's Oath blades, but that wasn't the case. This plugin adds King's Oath to Helseth's personal guards (the ones in the throne room, except Tienius Delitian and Karrod).
- [**LDM - Abolitionists**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47499) by Lucevar: refilters and adds on to vanilla dialogue about abolitionists, so that plantation and mine owners who make their money off slavery don't give the same line as other Hlaalu, who are more ambivalent about the practice. 
- [**LDM - Balmora Rumour Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47455) by Lucevar: adds an option to refuse Larrius Varro's Bloodbath quest, and edits the filtering on vanilla Balmora rumours so that they don't get overwritten by the Varro rumours. 16+ rumours now appear!

- [**Lore Friendly Iron Warhammer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45939?tab=files) by R-Zero and Petethegoat: matches the iron warhammer model to its in-game description.
- [**Outfit Greetings Tweaked**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46066?) by Anille: greetings regarding clothes are now limited to clothiers, nobles and snooty High Elves.
- [**Quarantined Vvardenfell**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47335) by Gavrilo93: as Asciene Rene's dialogue suggests, you won't be allowed to travel to Mournhold if you have a disease now. 
- [**Redaynia Restored**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47646) by R-Zero: there are several mentions of a fishing village at the site of Ald Redaynia in both in-game dialogue and books. This mod adds the missing village of Ald Redaynia. 
- [**Redoran Freeloaders**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47321) by Gavrilo93: if you are a Redoran, you can rent a room at the Flowers of Gold in Vivec for free, as the dialogue suggests.
- [**Severa Magia DB fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45647?) by Corsair83: updates Severa Magia's hideout to look and feel more like a Dark Brotherhood sanctuary. 
- [**Sheep-no-More**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45168) by McChuggernaut: removes the sheep sounds from Morrowind.
- [**Talos Cult Revised - G93's Version**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47571) by Gavrilo93: improves the Talos Cult shrine in the Gnisis legion barracks in an attempt to give a more interesting depiction of the cult.
- [**Telvanni Staff for the Telvanni Staff**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47869/) by Gavrilo93: according to in-game information, it seems that a Telvanni Mouth's symbol of office is the Silver Staff of Peace. Yet in vanilla, only you get one when you become a Mouth, which you would have to give to Fast Eddie when he becomes your Mouth. Therefore this mod adds a Silver Staff of Peace into the inventory of the six other Telvanni Mouths, including Baladas' Mouth, who only shows up mid-game.
- [**The Dream is the Door**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47423) by Melchior Dahrk: to align with what the in-game dialogue suggests, the entrance to the Cavern of the Incarnate will now only be visible during the magical hours of twilight. 
- [**The Madstone**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47653) by Melchior Dahrk: makes the Madstone work as described on the lore, adds a new model to the Madstone, and expands on in-game dialogue.
- [**Thickle-Lo - The Succulent Hackle-Lo Mod**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47502) by Melchior Dahrk: makes Hackle-lo leaves thicker as described in-game ("succulent").
- [**TriangleTooth's Missing Characters**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46234?) by TriangleTooth: adds new NPCs who were mentioned by dialogue but had no physical presence on Vvardenfell. Also gives them new unique dialogue lines that fit seamlessly into the vanilla game.
  - Hide/deactivate **Ttooth's Missing NPCs - Nolus.esp**.
- [**True Scourge**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43294/) by R-Zero: makes the Scourge artifact behave more like its description in the game books. Now any summoned Daedra hit by this weapon gets instantly banished back to Oblivion.
  - Hide/deactivate **True_Scourge_zerosouls.esp**.
- [**What is something that can be perceived with one of your senses of life - Something edgy related to death my brother**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47598) by Gavrilo93: adds Dark Brotherhood armor to the members of the faction in Vvardenfell.
  - Rename this mod to something shorter when installing it in MO2 if you don't want MO2 to bombard you with the same error message every time you modify your installation or load order.
