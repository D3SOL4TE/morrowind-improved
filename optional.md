# OPTIONAL MODS

My mod list so far has contained mods which I vouch for, and which I enthusiastically recommend. This section is separate from it because the mods you are going to see here don't fit the standard of quality I hold for the rest of the mod list. This doesn't mean I do not recommend these mods, as I personally use them. All this means is that these mods have issues some people are more than willing to forgive, and others aren't.

So far, below a mod's download link and description you would see installation instructions and nothing else. This time, I'm also including a brief paragraph at the start of each section that explains why these mods can be a matter of discussion.

What applied for my mod list applies here too: there are minimum standards for compatibility that mods have to abide with, and the mods in this list are perfectly compatible with the mods from the main mod list. I will, of course, provide and adjusted mod order and load order that includes these mods.

## Leveling

## Better Bodies

**Better Bodies** and related mods, including those whose assets are made with Better Bodies in mind, can be found here. For many players, Better Bodies is a must due to the ridiculous appearance of the segmented vanilla bodies. For others, the vanilla bodies are superior to Better Bodies, artistically and technically.

Better Bodies is not perfect. For that reason, neither are the vanilla bodies: there *is* clipping going on with the vanilla meshes, for instance. But the truth is that the vanilla bodies are artistically cohesive with each other, and also with the world surrounding them, in a way that Better Bodies simply does not.

Still, no argument can disuade people from a simple fact of life: either you like Better Bodies better, or you like the vanilla bodies better, and no one will change your mind. Thus this section. I've taken the liberty to repackage and patch most of these mods since the packaging was terrible and made this section far longer than it needed be. Links to the original mods and the files included in these repackages can be found in the **Credits** section.

### Visually consistent with Better Bodies

These mods don't require Better Bodies, but you will find them to be somewhat inconsistent with the vanilla bodies. Indeed, most of these use assets based off Better Bodies

- [**Better Dwarven Spectres - Mer and Maidens Edition**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45617) by Melchior Dahrk: adds female Dwarven Spectres to the leveled lists and replaces one unique spectre with the new model. This mod is also a Better Bodies conversion of the original Dwarven Spectre. The mod also adds the robe worn by the spectres as a random drop from them, complete with male and female versions.
- [**Mage Robes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45739) by Melchior Dahrk: many Mages Guild members will now wear new Mages Guild robes and the player can acquire the robes through quests and purchase.
- [**Morag Tong Armor**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44938) by NazoX9: adds armor pieces to complete the Morag Tong armor set. The armor has been distributed throughout the game on members of the Morag Tong, and is awarded to you at the end of the first quest for the Morag Tong.
- [**Golden Saint Variety v1.2 (Sigourn Edit)**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/o2rjz08ba5z6ycl/Golden_Saint_Variety_v1.2_%28Sigourn_Edit%29.zip/file) by Leyawynn: adds 4 versions of Golden Saints, all integrated into the same levelled lists and with the same stats. This will just make fighting Golden Saints more fun, as they won't look the same every time.
  - This is an edit of the original mod that removes the Golden Saint clad in Gold Armor, and reduces textures to a more vanilla-friendly resolution.

## Lighting

Morrowind has very flat lighting. Areas that should be dark don't look particularly dark, and this completely destroy the atmosphere of some locations. There's a reason why lighting is so important in films and photography, and it holds true for videogames as well.

There are many mods that rectify this, to different degrees and with different results. The most common of them are **The Lighting Mod**, **True Lights and Darkness**, and **di.Still.ed Lights**. A new mod that is fully configurable has been released in May 2020, called **Let There Be Darkness - Lua Lighting Overhaul**, but for the purpose of this section we will only be installing **di.Still.ed Lights**.

Why is this section optional? Because lighting mods for Morrowind aren't perfect. Darken a cell too much for realism, and you will find you can't see anything at all, even with light sources, because light sources weren't designed with such levels of darkness in mind. Brighten and increase the radius of light sources to compensate, and you will find yourself with lots of ugly lighting seams, where there's a hard edge between "lit" and "unlit".

That said, I find this section worth the inconveniences (some cells being too dark, some lighting seams here and there, and some garish lighting spots, such as the intro of the game where Jiub looks like an Altmer because of the yellow lighting). Only you can decide. Rest assured that you can uninstall these mods mid-playthrough with no side effects, so feel free to take them for a spin until you decide whether they are good enough for you.

- [**di.Still.ed Lights**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46291) by multiple: removes flicker effect from all light sources except fire flames, rationalizes every light emittance in the game, and darkens interiors.
  - This mod requires specific MGE XE install instructions. Read the mod page carefully.
- [**di.Still.ed Lights - No-Frills Closed Molag Mar Patch**](http://www.mediafire.com/file/by5vnre62t5fwws/di.Still.ed_Lights_v1.0_-_No-Frills_Closed_Molag_Mar_v1.1_Patch.zip/file) by Sigourn: applies di.Still.ed Lights settings to the Molag Mar canton.
  - Only if you installed **No-Frills Closed Molag Mar** earlier.
- [**No Unnatural Lights**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47126) by Necrolesian: disables all unnatural light sources in the game by changing the radius of the relevant lights to zero.
  - Only install the **No Interior Blue Water Glow** old file. The main file will disable lights we don't want disabled, like those emanating from crystals or Bitter Coast mushrooms.
- [**Negative Lights Remover**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42306) by PeterBitt: disables unpleasant black "lights", which are used in the vanilla game to simulate dark areas inside a cell, and which look terrible when using MGE XE's Per Pixel Lighting setting.
