# OPTIONAL MODS

My mod list so far has contained mods which I vouch for, and which I enthusiastically recommend. This section is separate from it because the mods you are going to see here don't fit the standard of quality I hold for the rest of the mod list. This doesn't mean I do not recommend these mods, as I personally use them. All this means is that these mods have issues some people are more than willing to forgive, and others aren't.

So far, below a mod's download link and description you would see installation instructions and nothing else. This time, I'm also including a brief paragraph at the start of each section that explains why these mods can be a matter of discussion.

What applied for my mod list applies here too: there are minimum standards for compatibility that mods have to abide with, and the mods in this list are perfectly compatible with the mods from the main mod list. I will, of course, provide and adjusted mod order and load order that includes these mods.

## Better Bodies

**Better Bodies** and related mods, including those whose assets are based off Better Bodies, can be found here. For many players, Better Bodies is a must due to the ridiculous appearance of the segmented vanilla bodies. For others, the vanilla bodies are superior to Better Bodies, artistically and technically.

Better Bodies is not perfect. For that reason, neither are the vanilla bodies: there *is* clipping going on with the vanilla meshes, for instance. But the truth is that the vanilla bodies are artistically cohesive with each other, and also with the world surrounding them, in a way that Better Bodies simply does not.

Still, no argument can disuade people from a simple fact of life: either you like Better Bodies better, or you like the vanilla bodies better. Thus this section. I've taken the liberty to repackage and patch most of these mods since the packaging was terrible and made this section far longer than it needed be. Links to the original mods and the files implemented can be found in the **Credits** section.
