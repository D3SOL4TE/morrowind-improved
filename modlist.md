- [**Weapon Sheathing**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46069) by akortunov, Greatness7, Heinrich, Hrnchamd, London Rook, Lord Berandas, Melchior Dahrk, MementoMoritius, NullCascade, PetetheGoat, PikachunoTM, and Remiros: equipped weapons will be shown on the character's hip or back. This new functionality affects both the player and all other characters, and works with all weapons from all mods. Additionally features a comprehensive set of high quality quiver and scabbard assets.
  - Only install the **WeaponSheathing 1.6-MWSE** main file.
  - This mod is incorrectly packaged. Set **Data Files** as the proper **Data** directory in MO2.
- [**Weather Adjuster**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46816) by Hrnchamd: regional weather colours, skies and lighting. Visual weather editor and region-based presets. Seamless transitions between regions.
  - This mod lets you adjust many variables about Morrowind's weather. Read the description to learn how to do this. The reason I recommend it (aside because of how great the mod is) is that users can share their presets: the mod on its own will not change the appearance of the game until you configure it so.
- [**Weather Adjuster - Sigourn's Mod List json**](http://www.mediafire.com/file/r7vlwhoko8rg2co/Weather_Adjuster_-_Sigourn%2527s_Mod_List_json.zip/file) by Sigourn: personal preset for darker nights and less horrible fog.
  - This mod has to be installed manually. Unpack the file and merge the **overwrite** folder with your Mod Organizer 2 **overwrite** folder, found inside the **Mod Organizer 2** folder. The contents of the folder should like so: **Mod Organizer 2\overwrite\MWSE\config\Weather Adjuster.json**.
  - [**Comparison here.**](https://imgsli.com/MTUwMjI)
- [**Well Diversified**](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7fv2wojbp6y3uo9/AABIH_hMYjbqmZCPBnyu4NPqa?dl=0&preview=Well+Diversified.7z) by Slartibartfast: creates variants of the well mesh to better fit Imperial and Solstheim architecture.
  - This mod is incorrectly packaged. Place the **x** folder inside the **\Data Files\Meshes** folder.
- [**Wolf Helmet Replacer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/29281) by Alaisiagae: replaces the Wolf and Snow Wolf Helmets with a ferocious wolf head with gaping jaws.

### READABLE SIGNPOSTS

Choose between one of these two alternatives for readable signposts. My personal preference is PeterBitt's, but if you are a vanilla purist nothing beats Atrayonis'.

- [**Near Vanilla Road Sign Replacer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44957?) by Atrayonis: makes road signs legible. Uses vanilla background and resolution.
  - MO2 will install this mod as a BAIN package. Tick the following options and click **OK**:
    - **00 Core**
    - **01 Vvardenfell only**
- [**Signposts Retextured**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42126?) by PeterBitt: makes road signs legible. Uses higher quality vanilla-friendly textures.
  - Install only one of the main files.

### MGE XE MODS

The following mods require specific MGE XE install instructions. Read the mod pages carefully.

The quakes are implemented strictly for atmospheric purposes and should not directly affect gameplay or conflict with any other mods.
  - I recommend opening up the console in-game and typing **set fQuakeChance to 5** to reduce earthquake chance from 30% to 5%.

## AUDIO

- [**Distant Thunder**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43471) by TheInkBunny: adds a randomized bit of lead time to thunderclaps after lightning strikes for additional realism.

For stormy weather types the script uses the regular flag2.wav sound file.
- [**Shut the Fuck up Cliff Racers**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46588) by Merlord: drastically reduces the frequency of idle Cliff Racer screeches, by editing the kf file of the cliff racer mesh.

- [**Service Requirements Lore**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45567) by Vanhikes and dungeom: factions will limit their services based on faction affiliation and rank.

- [**Limited Leaping**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46299) by NullCascade: puts optional restrictions on jumping, including a cooldown and/or minimum fatigue.
- [**Morrowind Anti-Cheese**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47305) by Remiros and Half11: fixes the biggest exploits and balance issues in the game.
- [**Smart Merchants**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47787) by abot: configurable mod that can increase the Mercantile and Speechcraft skills of all NPCs, making it harder to barter with them, persuade them, and bribe them. Doesn't interfere with Trainers' services.

  - Note that because of the changes this mod makes, certain quests taking places inside Red Mountain (such as [Viatrix, The Annoying Pilgrim](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Viatrix,_The_Annoying_Pilgrim) and [Pilgrimages of the Seven Graces](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Pilgrimages_of_the_Seven_Graces)) may be very difficult to complete if **Blight is Coming** is used alongside **Beware the Sixt House**. You can also expect a massive difficult spike over the course of the Main Quest.

The following mod should only be installed if you are playing with the official **Siege at Firemoth** plugin or the merged **Unofficial Morrowind Official Plugins Patched** plugin.

- [**Siege at Firemoth Weapon Gimp**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47730) by Necrolesian: replaces two high-end weapons held by the followers in the official plugin Siege at Firemoth with less powerful weapons.

## MISCELLANEOUS
