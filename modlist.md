Sigourn's Mod List is just that, a list of Morrowind mods I use and recommend. In spite of its size, with over 100 mods, it is a mod list that is actually fairly lightweight in what it adds and changes from the game. 

Many of these mods are so minor that most people wouldn't even think of installing them. Almost all of them are very well integrated into the game to the point the only clue someone may have they have installed a mod is the very act of doing so, and the existence of an in-game mod configuration menu. Mods that function correctly and without annoying issues were a priority for this mod list.

Notable mod categories which are absent from this list are:

- Visual upgrades that aren't suggested because of internal consistency or because they add something to the game.
- Player homes.
- Quest tweaks, new quests, new factions, etc.

## A WORD OF ADVICE

Every single mod present in this guide is a mod I use or, in very few exceptions, a mod that is an alternative to a mod I'm using. Absent from this guide are mods I do not use, for a simple reason: if I'm not using it, it is because...

- I do not think it is a good mod.
- I think it is a good mod, but with flaws that stop me from using it.
- I'm not interested in said mod.
- I haven't gotten to play with it yet because it drastically modifies aspects of the game (the world, the factions, the quests) that I've yet to experience as the devs intended.
- I'm not aware of said mod's existence. This only applies for "obscure" mods, as all the popular ones are covered by the four exceptions mentioned above.

I want to make this clear from the start because no doubt some people will wonder why "X" mod which is very popular was not included in the guide.

The good news is that because I use every single mod in this list (minor conflicting alternatives) I have a good idea of the level of compatibility between the mods listed here. As such, I can tell you the conflicts are kept to a minimum, to ensure the appropriate enjoyment of each of the mods present here.

The bad news is that because of the complexity of the guide, some modding experience is required. People with modding experience in future Bethesda titles will feel right at home and should have no issues whatsoever. People with no modding experience, I suggest you read the mods' descriptions and installation instructions before installing them in your game.

## ON MENDED MORROWIND

Morrowind Improved is the sister mod list to Mended Morrowind, a short and sweet guide to ironing out many of Morrowind's bugs and optimization issues. My intention is that you use this mod list in tandem with Mended Morrowind.
