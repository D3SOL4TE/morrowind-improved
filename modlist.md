The goal of Morrowind Improved is to offer new and veteran Morrowind players the best lightweight modded Morrowind experience, as free of bugs and stability issues as reasonably possible, without sacrificing the elements that make Morrowind Morrowind, by boosting everything that makes Morrowind great and polishing the rough edges off the game.

Notable mod categories not present in this list are:

Retextures: Morrowind boasts an unique visual style. Retextures will only be present if certain vanilla textures are considerably lacking compared to the rest of the game.
High quality meshes: again, the guide aims for visual consistency, which is why these are out of the question as, broadly speaking, Morrowind’s meshes are just fine.
Player homes: the best person to decide whether a player home is good for you is yourself.
Quest mods: be it new questlines or tweaks to existing quests, the truth is I have no experience with any quest mod and thus recommending them would be dishonest.
Major gameplay mods, mostly because I haven’t gotten around to adding them yet.
