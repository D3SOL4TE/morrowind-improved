# BALANCE

The major rebalances we will be installing are mort's trilogy of rebalances.

- [**Beware the Sixth House (Sixth House Overhaul)**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46036) by mort: makes the Sixth House, properly, the most difficult content in the game.
- [**Tribunal Rebalance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45713) by mort: rebalances Tribunal as if it shipped with Morrowind.
- [**Bloodmoon Rebalance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45714) by mort: rebalances Bloodmoon as if it shipped with Morrowind.

The following rebalances modify certain, specific aspects of the game.

- [**Better Balanced Booze**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45844) by mort: rebalances alcohol so that it is less effective than potions.
  - Only install the **Better Balanced Booze - Heavy Drinker Mode** main file.
- [**Controlled Consumption**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45624) by NullCascade: provides a configurable restriction on the amount of potions the player can drink at any one time, removing one of the largest exploits in the game.
- [**Higher Faction Requirements**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45732) by King Feraligatr: makes factions have higher requirements for advancing.
  - Hide/deactive **higher faction requirements - Morrowind Only.esp**.
- [**Limited Leaping**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46299) by NullCascade: puts optional restrictions on jumping, including a cooldown and/or minimum fatigue.
- [**Marksman Rebalanced**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46715) by Merlord: takes into account the distance to target when calculating the hit chance for ranged weapons. This applies to both the player and NPCs. Crouching also provides a boost to hit chance.
- [**Morrowind Anti-Cheese**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47305) by Remiros and Half11: fixes the biggest exploits and balance issues in the game.
- [**No Rest Without Beds**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46724) by Kaedius: prevents the player from resting unless they activate a bed.
- [**One of a Kind - Daedric Weapons Armor and Shields**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44923) by mort: edits leveled lists and static spawns to ensure only one copy of each daedric weapon, armor, and shield exists in game. Optionally edits a few quests and NPCs to give ebony instead of daedric rewards.
- [**Purist Friendly Magicka Regen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45636) by Remiros and Greatness7: adds fully functioning magicka regeneration to the game.
- [**Projectile Enchant Capacity**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46685) by pianobadger: creates balanced enchant values for all projectiles in Morrowind to better make use of the Morrowind Code Patch "Arrow enchanting" option.
- [**Realistic Movement Speeds**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46248) by OperatorJack: modifies movement speeds when strafing or backpedalling so that they are more realistic. NPCs and player alike will no longer be able to fire volleys of arrows while running backwards to safety. Movement direction is now tactically important.
- [**Service Requirements Lore**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45567) by Vanhikes and dungeom: factions will limit their services based on faction affiliation and rank.
  - This mod is incorrectly packaged. Set **Service Requirements Lore** as the proper **Data** directory in MO2.
- [**Smart Merchants**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47787) by abot: configurable mod that can increase the Mercantile and Speechcraft skills of all NPCs, making it harder to barter with them, persuade them, and bribe them. Doesn't interfere with Trainers' services.

The following mod should only be installed if you are playing with the official Siege of Firemoth plugin.

- [**Siege at Firemoth Weapon Gimp**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47730) by Necrolesian: replaces two high-end weapons held by the followers in the official plugin Siege at Firemoth with less powerful weapons.
