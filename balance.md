# BALANCE

## MAIN CONTENT

- [**Tribunal Rebalance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45713) by mort: rebalances Tribunal as if it shipped with Morrowind.
- [**Bloodmoon Rebalance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45714) by mort: rebalances Bloodmoon as if it shipped with Morrowind.

## ANTI-CHEESING

- [**Morrowind Anti-Cheese**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47305) by Remiros and Half11: fixes the biggest exploits and balance issues in the game.
- [**Controlled Consumption**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45624) by NullCascade: provides a configurable restriction on the amount of potions the player can drink at any one time, removing one of the largest exploits in the game.
- [**Limited Leaping**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46299) by NullCascade: puts optional restrictions on jumping, including a cooldown and/or minimum fatigue.
- [**No Rest Without Beds**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46724) by Kaedius: prevents the player from resting unless they activate a bed.
- [**Siege at Firemoth Weapon Gimp**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47730) by Necrolesian: replaces two high-end weapons held by the followers in the official plugin Siege at Firemoth with less powerful weapons.

## ECONOMY

- [**Harder Barter**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46188) by mort: merchants will now pay less for the more expensive items.
- [**Harder Merchants**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47416) by Greatness7: increases the Mercantile skill of all NPCs. Doesn't interfere with Trainers' services.
- [**One of a Kind - Daedric Weapons Armor and Shields**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44923) by mort: edits leveled lists and static spawns to ensure only one copy of each daedric weapon, armor, and shield exists in game. Optionally edits a few quests and NPCs to give ebony instead of daedric rewards.

## FACTIONS

- [**Higher Faction Requirements**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45732) by King Feraligatr: makes factions have higher requirements for advancing.
  - Hide/deactive **higher faction requirements - Morrowind Only.esp**.
- [**Service Requirements Lore**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45567) by Vanhikes and dungeom: factions will limit their services based on faction affiliation and rank.
  - This mod is incorrectly packaged. Set **Service Requirements Lore** as the proper **Data** directory in MO2.

## MECHANICS

- [**Better Balanced Booze**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45844) by mort: rebalances alcohol so that it is less effective than potions.
  - Only install the **Better Balanced Booze - Heavy Drinker Mode** main file.
- [**Marksman Rebalanced**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46715) by Merlord: takes into account the distance to target when calculating the hit chance for ranged weapons. This applies to both the player and NPCs. Crouching also provides a boost to hit chance.
- [**Projectile Enchant Capacity**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46685) by pianobadger: creates balanced enchant values for all projectiles in Morrowind to better make use of the Morrowind Code Patch "Arrow enchanting" option.
- [**Realistic Movement Speeds**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46248) by OperatorJack: modifies movement speeds when strafing or backpedalling so that they are more realistic. NPCs and player alike will no longer be able to fire volleys of arrows while running backwards to safety. Movement direction is now tactically important.
- [**Speed and Movement Rebalanced**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46029) by Remiros: rebalances the speed attribute and overall movement in the game in an attempt to make it feel more natural.
- [**Talrivian's State-Based HP Mod**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-90-6521) by Talrivian and HotFusion: modifies how HP is calculated, leading to less metagaming.
