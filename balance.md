# BALANCE

- [**Beware the Sixth House (Sixth House Overhaul)**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46036) by mort: makes the Sixth House, properly, the most difficult content in the game.
- [**Tribunal Rebalance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45713) by mort: rebalances Tribunal as if it shipped with Morrowind.
- [**Bloodmoon Rebalance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45714) by mort: rebalances Bloodmoon as if it shipped with Morrowind.
- [**Morrowind Anti-Cheese**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47305) by Remiros and Half11: fixes the biggest exploits and balance issues in the game.
- [**Controlled Consumption**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45624) by NullCascade: provides a configurable restriction on the amount of potions the player can drink at any one time, removing one of the largest exploits in the game.
- [**Limited Leaping**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46299) by NullCascade: puts optional restrictions on jumping, including a cooldown and/or minimum fatigue.
- [**No Rest Without Beds**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46724) by Kaedius: prevents the player from resting unless they activate a bed.
- [**Siege at Firemoth Weapon Gimp**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47730) by Necrolesian: replaces two high-end weapons held by the followers in the official plugin Siege at Firemoth with less powerful weapons.
- [**Smart Merchants**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47787) by abot: configurable mod that can increase the Mercantile and Speechcraft skills of all NPCs, making it harder to barter with them, persuade them, and bribe them. Doesn't interfere with Trainers' services.
- [**One of a Kind - Daedric Weapons Armor and Shields**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44923) by mort: edits leveled lists and static spawns to ensure only one copy of each daedric weapon, armor, and shield exists in game. Optionally edits a few quests and NPCs to give ebony instead of daedric rewards.
- [**Higher Faction Requirements**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45732) by King Feraligatr: makes factions have higher requirements for advancing.
  - Hide/deactive **higher faction requirements - Morrowind Only.esp**.
- [**Service Requirements Lore**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45567) by Vanhikes and dungeom: factions will limit their services based on faction affiliation and rank.
  - This mod is incorrectly packaged. Set **Service Requirements Lore** as the proper **Data** directory in MO2.
- [**Better Balanced Booze**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45844) by mort: rebalances alcohol so that it is less effective than potions.
  - Only install the **Better Balanced Booze - Heavy Drinker Mode** main file.
- [**Marksman Rebalanced**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46715) by Merlord: takes into account the distance to target when calculating the hit chance for ranged weapons. This applies to both the player and NPCs. Crouching also provides a boost to hit chance.
- [**Projectile Enchant Capacity**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46685) by pianobadger: creates balanced enchant values for all projectiles in Morrowind to better make use of the Morrowind Code Patch "Arrow enchanting" option.
- [**Realistic Movement Speeds**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46248) by OperatorJack: modifies movement speeds when strafing or backpedalling so that they are more realistic. NPCs and player alike will no longer be able to fire volleys of arrows while running backwards to safety. Movement direction is now tactically important.
- [**Speed and Movement Rebalanced**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46029) by Remiros: rebalances the speed attribute and overall movement in the game in an attempt to make it feel more natural. Also introduces a sprinting mechanic, mapped to the Alt button.
  - If you are not interested in the sprinting mechanic, simply hide/delete the **MWSE** folder found inside the mod.
  - I recommend deleting the **fJumpRunMultiplier** record in TESAME. You will now move faster while jumping, which is crucial to clearing some obstacles in the game.
- [**Talrivian's State-Based HP Mod**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-90-6521) by Talrivian and HotFusion: modifies how HP is calculated, leading to less metagaming.
