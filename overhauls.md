# OVERHAULS

- [**Atmospheric Delights**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47472) by Lucevar: interior overhaul of Desele's House of Earthly Delights to be more atmospheric. Adds several new NPCs with unique dialogue, including a bouncer and several new patrons. The NPCs now use a custom set of vanilla voice lines to better capture their role and personalities. 
- [**Brevur of Balmora - Finally Some Good Statue Mod**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47557) by R-Zero: adds a statue of Hlaalu Brevur to Balmora High Town district.
- [**Cavern Of The Incarnate Overhaul**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42860/) by Aoimevelho: bump-maps the Cavern of the Incarnate and the Azura statue meshes, adds flowers, grass, and tiny fireflies, and modifies the armor and clothes on some of the failed incarnates.
  - You can disable the bump-mapping on the cavern and the statue by hiding/deleting the files inside **Meshes\i**.
- [**Frostmoth Repaired**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-68-2286) by Talthybius: repairs the walls of Fort Frostmoth as you reach the end of the Bloodmoon main quest.
- [**Meteorite Ministry**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45506) by Zobator: adds a tail of smaller rocks to the Ministry of Truth, giving it a more dramatic and moving-object-suspended-in-mid-flight look.
  - Only activate one of the plugins. I recommend **Meteorite Ministry Temple - Higher.esp**.
- [**No-Frills Open Vivec**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43714) by Atrayonis: opens up the Vivec cantons.
- [**Passage of Prayers - High Fane Corridor Overhaul**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46786) by Leyawynn, Sataniel, and Remiros: makes the previously empty high fane corridor a more interesting location.
  - Hide/deactivate **Passage of Prayers - No Lore.esp**.

- [**RR Mod Series - Ghostgate Fortress**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45822?) by Resdayn Revival Team: new models and textures for Ghostgate and Ghostfence pylons based on Morrowind concept art.
  - MO2 will install this mod as a BAIN package. Tick **00 - Main Files**, **01 - Main ESP - English**, **03 - Main Files - Glow in the Dahrk Patch**, and **06 - Optional - Better Ghostfence Pillars - Scythe**.

- [**Samarys Ancestral Tomb Expanded**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45612) by ATL Team and PikachunoTM: turns Samarys Ancestral Tomb from a simple three-room dungeon into a much larger dungeon with an unmarked quest.
- [**Seven Graces Shrines Enhanced**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46417) by QueenLunara: redesigns the shrines associated with the Seven Graces pilgrimage, making them look more important and like actual pilgrimage sites.
  - Also install the **Seven Graces Shrines Enhanced - No Script Edits** optional file.
- [**Tower of Vos**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43527) by Melchior Dahrk: makes the Tower of Vos much taller than before, and adds a group of guards called War Wizards that patrol the exterior of the stronghold.
