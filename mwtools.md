## TOOLS

Many Morrowind tools have been made available over the years. Their purpose varies: some are used to clean mods, other to check conflicts, a few others to edit mods, and so on.

Because Mod Organizer 2 installs mods in a virtual file system, many of these tools won't work with Mod Organizer 2 out of the box. Before adding them to Mod Organizer 2, however, we need to download them.

- [**TESTool**](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Tes3Mod:TESTool): TESTool is a mod management, repair and cleaning utility.
- [**TESAME**](http://wiki.theassimilationlab.com/mmw/TESAME): The Elder Scrolls Advanced Mod Editor is a tool used by both modders and players that can clean dirty mods, and merge any two mods.
- [**MWEdit**](http://wiki.theassimilationlab.com/mmw/MWEdit): MWEdit is an unofficial incomplete alternate editor for Morrowind plugin files (ESPs and ESMs). It allows creating, editing and deleting records in a plugin file and has different and extra features compared to the Construction Set.
- [**TES3View**](http://www.mediafire.com/file/g10ay0bqynval8s/TES3View_%2528xEdit_4.1.3a_EXTREMELY_EXPERIMENTAL%2529.zip/file): TES3View is an advanced graphical module viewer and conflict detector for Morrowind, created by ElminsterAU and the xEdit Team. 
  - The version I'm hosting on MediaFire can be downloaded from [**xEdit's Discord**](https://discordapp.com/invite/5t8RnNQ) under **xedit-builds**, called **xEdit_4.1.3a_EXTREMELY_EXPERIMENTAL.7z**. Both the folder and the .exe have been renamed to TES3View in order for the tool to work for Morrowind.
- [**TES3Merge**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46870): this tool helps to automatically patch conflicts between mods for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind.
- [**tes3cmd**](http://wiki.theassimilationlab.com/mmw/TES3cmd): tes3cmd is a command-line tool which is used for examining and modifying TES3 plugins in various ways. It can also create a patch for various problems and merge leveled lists. Most importantly, it can be used to clean plugins.
