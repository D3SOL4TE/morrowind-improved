## USEFUL TIPS

A crash course to Morrowind and Bethesda modding in general is:

- Don't uninstall mods mid-playthrough, and if you do, keep a pre-uninstallation savefile as a backup in case things go wrong.
- Read the description of every mod you install. Descriptions usually list requirements, compatibility issues, and known issues in a mod. This not only prevents future issues (or assures you they are "normal" or "expected"), but it also helps you decide beforehand whether a mod is worth the trouble.
- File structure matters when installing a mod. The file structure is how files are organized for the game to read these files and use them. Incorrect file structure accounts for a good deal of mods that don’t work properly. For instance, .esm and .esp files always need to be inside **Morrowind\Data Files**, or else the game simply won't register them. When a mod listed here has packaging issues, I will tell you how to fix them. Bear in mind that some mods do keep optional plugins in a separate folder, but these are the exception and descriptions usually make mentions of them.
- Some mods come with BSA files. These contain data files for the mod. The most popular mod which includes BSA files is the Tamriel Rebuilt project, which is not part of this guide. BSA files need to be registered in your Morrowind.ini file for the game to properly load the assets; failing to due so results in a well known problem of [**yellow exclamation triangles**](https://external-preview.redd.it/dl-I4l_Pzm5autet-87p1hnU1btUavtiu1mtwGzWBko.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=3d180a6476cad80c332c12be08252511a0044c5c). This particular guide, however, features no mods with BSA files.

When installing mods manually, by extracting the contents of a mod and dropping them inside your Data Files folder, there is a chance you will be overwriting one mod's files with another mod's. This is where mod managers come in: they make modding easy by providing you with lots of tools to aid you in modding your game.

**Mod Organizer 2** lets you hide specific files from your installed mods, including anything from meshes to textures, but also plugins. This is a especially useful feature when you deactivate certain plugins from a mod but don't want to see them cluttering up your load order, or you want to certain files not to overwrite another mod's.

- To hide a plugin, right click on your installed mod and select **Information...**.
- Select the **Filetree** tab.
- Right click on the plugins, folders, or files you want to hide, and select **Hide**.
- Mod Organizer 2 will hide the files, and these will no longer affect your game.

One more quirk about Mod Organizer 2 is the **Overwrite** folder and how it ties together with the tools we installed in the **Setup** section. The **Overwrite** folder is the destiny folder for the output of many of these tools. For instance, Distant Land generation will place its contents here, inside the **distantland** folder. Files in the **Overwrite** folder will overwrite all your installed assets and plugins, should they have the same names.

Now that we have installed all tools, our Mod Manager, and MGE XE, we can finally get onto patching Morrowind itself.

## MORROWIND CODE PATCH

The Morrowind Code Patch patches bugs in the Morrowind program (Morrowind.exe), which cannot otherwise be fixed by editing scripts or data files. It is a must-have utility for anyone who plays with vanilla Morrowind, as opposed to OpenMW.

Unlike mods, the Morrowind Code Patch requires specific install instructions, and can't be installed through Mod Organizer 2.

1. First, download the **Morrowind Code Patch** main file from [**Morrowind Code Patch**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/19510?tab=files).
2. Extract the contents of the file to your Morrowind root directory, so that Morrowind Code Patch.exe and the mcpatch folder are in the same folder as Morrowind.exe.
3. Now download the **MCP beta** update file from [**Morrowind Code Patch Update**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/26348/?tab=files).
4. Extract the contents of the file to your Morrowind root directory, and overwrite when prompted. This will update the Morrowind Code Patch to version 2.5b4.
5. Right click on Morrowind Code Patch.exe and select **Run as Administrator**.
6. The amount of options available can be overwhelming. My recommendation is to install or skip patches as per [**this handy Google Sheets document**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r6fv59to4-KgHJgCm-GDNnwSmD3LdDmamSDEs5jKFdM/edit?usp=sharing).

Once you finish installing the Morrowind Code Patch a **Morrowind.Original.exe** will appear in your Morrowind folder, and you will be done.

## HIGH RESOLUTION TEXTURES

This mod list does not condone the use of using texture replacers for the sake of it. However, that does not mean the purist Mororwind player is out of good alternatives for the vanilla textures.

- [**Morrowind Uncompressed Vanilla Textures**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45551) by Bethesda Softworks: replaces most vanilla textures with unused textures that have less compression artifacts found in the game's Data Files folder.
- [**Intelligent Textures**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47469) by Remiros: replaces almost all textures in the vanilla game and its expansions with high resolution AI upscales.
  - MO2 will install this mod as a BAIN package. Tick **00 Core** and click **OK**.
  - Now install a second instance of this mod. This time, tick **01 Atlas Textures** and click **OK**.
  - MO2 will tell you the mod already exists. Click **Rename**. I suggest modifying it to read **Intelligent Textures v2.1 - Atlas Textures**. Click **OK**.
  - Also install the **Wood Fix** update file.
  - Also install [**this hotfix**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/impju2r934eqkkt/Intelligent_Textures_Ashlander_Hotfix_v2.zip/file), which will fix a bug with one of the ashlander hairstyles.

## BUG FIXES

- [**Patch for Purists**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45096) by half11: unofficial patch that aims to make the game completely bug-free (within the abilities of TESCS). In addition to being under active development, it diverges from later versions of the community patches in that it aims to only fix bugs (avoiding unnecessary balance and gameplay changes), takes a more conservative approach about what it considers a bug, and implementing bug fixes in coordination with Tamriel Rebuilt and the Project Tamriel projects.
- [**Correct UV Rocks**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-56-12003) by Nich: fixes UV mapping on rocks and stones.
- [**Expeditious Exit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45634) by NullCascade: forces the game to instantly close on exit.
- [**Glowing Flames**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46124) by PoodleSandwich: fixes issues regarding light sources in the game.
  - Hide/deactivate **Glowing Flames - TrueLightsAndDarkness Tweaks.esp**.
- [**Immersive Run Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45947) by Petethegoat: normalizes the player's movement speed, ensuring they run at a consistent speed even during diagonal movement. 
- [**No More Stage Diving - Desele's Dancing Girls**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47738) by Pherim: keeps the girls in Desele's House of Earthly Delights from dancing off the stage by making them not greet the player as he approaches them. 
  - Only install the **No More Stage Diving** main file.
  - Hide/deactive **NoMoreStageDiving_TalkativeGirls.esp**.
- [**Quest Skill Reward Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48269) by Merzasphor: makes the game treat skill increases from quests as if there were raised via normal means, solving numerous problems with how the game treats these skill increases.
- [**Skill Increase GMST Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48029) by Merzasphor: fixes several engine bugs related to GMSTs used when raising skills via NPC training and skill books.

## OPTIMIZATION

- [**Morrowind Optimization Patch**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45384?) by Remiros and Greatness7: greatly improves performance and fixes some mesh errors. MO2 will install the mod as a BAIN package. Tick **all options** and click **OK**.
  - Hide/delete **meshes\f\furn_web00.nif** and **meshes\f\furn_web10.nif**. These meshes are buggy and cause visual problems when seen from a distance.
- [**Project Atlas**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45399) by the Project Atlas Team: optimizes the most performance heavy areas of vanilla Morrowind through texture atlases. 
  - MO2 will install this mod as a BAIN package. Tick **00 Core** and click **OK**.
  - Hide/delete **meshes\x\ex_imp_plat_01.nif**. This mesh is buggy and can cause problems when traveling from Raven Rock to Fort Frostmoth using the boat.

## EXPANSION DELAY

- [**Expansion Delay**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47588?) by half11: modifies how the Tribunal and Bloodmoon expansions are implemented into the game.

## .INI EDITS

The Morrowind Code Patch **Rain/snow collision** patch requires a few .ini edits to work properly.

- Launch Mod Organizer 2.
- Click on the **Tools** icon, which resembles a jigsaw puzzle, and select **INI Editor**.
- On the morrowind.ini that just opened, adjust the following values. Use CTRL+F to input the bolded names and find them easily.
  - **[Weather Rain]**
