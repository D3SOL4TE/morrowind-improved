# EQUIPMENT

- [**Hunter's Mark - A Marksman Mod**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46656) by Remiros: adds a lot of new marksman weapons in an attempt to improve progression and fill in the gaps in the vanilla game. It includes new bows, crossbows, arrows, bolts and throwing weapons. All weapons have been seamlessly integrated into the game world via leveled lists and other means. The new Stalhrim items can be crafted in the same way as the vanilla items. All weapons have sheaths and quivers that are compatible with Weapon Sheathing.
- [**Imperial Silver Armor**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47751/) by Endoran: completes both sets of Imperial silver armour: the regular silver and the Duke's guard silver armour. It puts it in logical and lore friendly locations. You can find the regular silver armour on the guards in Ebonheart, and sold by Sirollus Saccus in the Hawkmoth Legion garrison. The silver cuirass has also been updated to be a recognized legion uniform. The Duke's silver armour is found on all of the Duke's guards and members of the Order of Ebonheart including the Knight of the Imperial Dragon. It is given to the player as a reward from Varus Vantinius after returning the Lord's Mail and becoming part of the Order of Ebonheart.
  - Also install the **Alternate Silver Helmet** optional file.
