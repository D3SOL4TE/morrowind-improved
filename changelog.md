# CHANGELOG

## APRIL 20th

- Added back RR Mod Series - Better Gnisis Arch (**Visuals**).
- Added back RR Mod Series - Holamayan Monastery Replacer (**Overhauls**).
- Added back RR Mod Series - Ghostgate Fortress (**Overhauls**).
- Added back the Intervention Improved compatibility patch for RR Mod Series - Ghostgate Fortress (**Gameplay**).

## APRIL 19th

- Added Better Robes (**Visuals**).
- Removed FMI - Ancient Altar (**Internal Logic**). The mod has been hidden from Nexus.
- Removed Healers (**Internal Logic**). Healers not providing actual healing services is not an internal logic issue, but an interpretation issue.
- Removed di.Still.ed Lights (**Visuals**). There are lighting issues that arise from this mod, most notably the pronounced difference between light and shadow which leads to pitch black areas on meshes that shouldn't look like so, on top of the game's dungeons not being designed around such a low light level.
- Removed Pincushion (**Visuals**). The visual effect leads to gameplay dissonance as the player cannot pick up the visible projectiles stuck on fallen enemies or the landscape, whether for their own inventory or to remove them from the game. The projectiles also don't stick to NPC heads.
- Removed RainSplash (**Visuals**). The visual effect is barely noticeable to justify the mod.
- Removed Vanilla Friendly Almalexia Replacer (**Visuals**). The retexture is unnecessary.
- Removed Umbra - Blademaster (**Gameplay**). The visual changes make Umbra stand out too much from the rest of the game.
- Removed Cloth Helm (**Equipment**). This mod doesn't solve a perceived flaw in the vanilla game.
- Removed the Better Bodies category in its entirety (**Better Bodies**). These mods are not up to the quality standard of this mod list.

## APRIL 18th

- Added Dagoth Ur Welcomes You (**Overhauls**).

## APRIL 14th

- Added Defensive Stance (**Gameplay**).
- Added Lucky Strike - A Critical Hit Mod (**Gameplay**).
- Added Speed and Movement Rebalanced (**Balance**).
- Removed Missing Ascended Sleeper Sounds Restored (**Content Restoration**). This fix will be included in the next **Patch for Purists** update.

## APRIL 13th

- Added Old Dwemer Books (**Miscellaneous**).
- Added Graphic Herbalism MWSE and OpenMW Edition (**Gameplay**).
- Added alternative Intervention Improved plugin for compatibility with Ghostgate Fortress (**Gameplay**).
- Added Smart Merchants (**Balance**).
- Removed Dwemer Books (**Content Restoration**). The new mesh and texture clash a lot with Arukinn's and Melchior Dahrk's book mods.
- Removed No Interior Blue Water Glow (**Visuals**).
- Removed Happy Harvesting (**Gameplay**). Replaced with Grabic Herbalism MWSE and OpenMW Edition.
- Removed Harder Barter (**Balance**). Replaced with Smart Merchants.
