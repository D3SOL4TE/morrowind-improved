- Removed [**Scummy Scum**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45802?) (**Visuals**). Replaced with Vanilla Friendly Scum Texture.

## April 25th Second Update

- Removed [**Speed and Movement Rebalanced**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46029) (**Balance**). Personal preference. May make your average movement speed slower if you tend to carry a lot of weight.
- Removed [**Talrivian's State-Based HP Mod**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-90-6521) (**Balance**). Because of how this mod works, Black-Heart Blight can prove devastating to characters (my own character was one-shotted repeatedly just by contracting the disease). It also inflates your HP too much.

## April 25th

- Fixed Weather Adjuster - Sigourn's Mod List json link (**Visuals**). Thanks to ShadowFyre for reporting it.
- Fixed No-Frills Open Vivec information in the loadorder.txt and mods.txt files. Previously they would refer to the non-recommended version, leaving Mod Organizer 2 unable to properly sort the plugin.
- Merged **Equipment** section with **Gameplay** section.

- Finally added Weather Adjuster, and my Weather Adjuster json configuration (**Visuals**).
- Added MGE XE shaders and shader chain instructions (**Mended Morrowind**).

## April 23rd

- Removed [**Better Robes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42773/) (**Visuals**). Personal preference, since the mod is based on Better Bodies assets.
- Removed [**Mages Robes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45739) (**Equipment**). Personal preference, since the mod is based on Better Bodies assets.
- Removed [**Morag Tong Armor**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44938) (**Equipment**). Personal preference, since the mod is based on Better Bodies assets.

## April 19th

- Moved Better Robes (**Visuals**).
- Removed [**FMI - Ancient Altar**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47187) (**Internal Logic**). The mod has been hidden from Nexus.
- Removed [**Healers**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47752) (**Internal Logic**). Personal preference. Replaced with Religions Elaborated.
- Removed [**di.Still.ed Lights**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46291) (**Visuals**). Personal preference. While there are bound to be some gameplay issues when a game isn't designed for low visibility (such as shadows not working as the player would expect), there are some lighting issues some players may find untolerable.
- Removed [**Pincushion**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46862) (**Visuals**). The visual effect leads to gameplay dissonance as the player cannot pick up the visible projectiles stuck on fallen enemies or the landscape, whether for their own inventory or to remove them from the game. The projectiles also don't stick to NPC heads.
- Removed [**RainSplash**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43124) (**Visuals**). Personal preference.
- Removed [**Vanilla-Friendly Almalexia Replacer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47068?) (**Visuals**). Personal preference.
- Removed [**Umbra - Blademaster**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43275) (**Gameplay**). Personal preference.
- Removed [**Cloth Helm**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47783) (**Equipment**). Personal preference.
- Removed the **Better Bodies** category. These mods vary in quality and execution, particularly Better Clothes Complete. The only vanilla compatible mod, **Better Robes**, has been kept.
  - [**Better Bodies ZW**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42395)
  - [**Lore-Friendly Better Bodies Underwear**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43065)
  - [**New Beast Bodies by Liztail**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47678)
  - [**Better Clothes Complete**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47549)
  - [**Better Morrowind Armor 2020**](http://www.mediafire.com/file/pffrp899uvuvg34/Better_Morrowind_Armor_2020_v1.0.zip/file)
  - [**Berserkers**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43528)
  - [**Better Dwarven Spectres - Mer and Maidens Edition**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45617)
