  - [**Empty Threats Disabler**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44671). Works as advertised. However, the mod's known glitch (advertised beforehand) makes me remove it.
- Game Balance
  - [**Smart Merchants**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47787). Works as advertised. However, it isn't enough to prevent the massive accumulation of cash, and sadly it doesn't solve the problem of gold exploits either.

If you are modifying Corsair's MW Inconsistencies, make sure you are not carrying Scrap Metal in your current save, or your carry weight could get bugged.

## May 8th

- Added No-Frills Closed Molag Mar (**Overhauls**).

## May 7th

- Removed [**Global Map Markers**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43248) (**User Interface**): there are two major reasons why this mod is removed, which are the cluttering of the only world map we are provided in-game, and also the loss of the sense of exploration when entering new cells which are named for their important landmarks. But most importantly, this mod is removed because of the devastating effects it has regarding the player's world map once the mod has been uninstalled, which include map markers devoid of any naming, and/or a completely wiped out world map. **Those that already have this mod installed shouldn't uninstall it mid-playthrough. I apologize for this mod's inclusion in the mod list.**

## May 4th

- Updated Intelligent Textures installation instructions (**Mended Morrowind**).

## May 1st

- Added back installation instructions for patches by popular demand (two or three users). One of the things I'm most proud of about this mod list is that people can pick and choose knowing these mods are very compatible with each other, so it is fitting that people have separate instructions in case they haven't installed a given mod earlier on.
- Added Keg Drip (**Visuals**).

## April 30th

- Simplified installation instructions when it comes to patches: if the mod list recommends a patch, it is expected that the player has installed the adequate mods beforehand. If the mod list has been followed to the letter, the adequate mods will have already been installed.
- Modified Necrolesian's Official Plugins Integrated (**Gameplay**). The edited Unofficial Morrowind Official Plugins Patched is now its own separate download.
- Added UMOPP v3.0.4 (Necrolesian's Official Plugins Integrated Compatible) (**Gameplay**).

## April 29th

- Drastically simplified installation instructions for the official plugins (**Mended Morrowind**). Now their merged installation is mandatory.
- Expanded on the instructions for plugin cleaning (**Tools**).
- Moved installation of Necrolesian's official plugins integration to the **Gameplay** section.
- Modified Melchior's Mudcrab Merchant with a link to a newer version (**Visuals**).
- Modified Facelift with instructions for installing its update (**Visuals**).
- Added Hortator Nerevarine Fix (**Gameplay**).
- Added Improved Cliff Racer AI (**Gameplay**).
- Added Necrolesian's Official Plugins Integrated (**Gameplay**).

## April 28th

- Fixed misleading installation instructions for the official plugins (**Mended Morrowind**) and Glow in the Dahrk (**Visuals**).
- Fixed wrong plugin in loadorder.txt (now properly reads Area Effect Arrows Integrated.esp).
- Added Vanilla Friendly Scum Texture (**Visuals**).
- Removed [**Scummy Scum**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45802?) (**Visuals**). Replaced with Vanilla Friendly Scum Texture.

## April 27th

- Complete overhaul of the mod list's format. All sections in one page.
- Moved Sound Spell Sound Effect (**Audio**) to the correct **Content Restoration** section.
- Added Great Service (**Content Restoration**).
- Added Telvanni Staff for the Telvanni Staff (**Internal Logic**).
- Added Pete's Scroll 2018 ...in 2020 (**Visuals**).
- Added Settled Jiub (**Miscellaneous**).
- Added Brutal Backstabbing (**Gameplay**).
- Added Supply Chests Merged (**Gameplay**).
- Added Purist Friendly Magicka Regen (**Balance**).
- Removed [**Smaller Rats**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46420) (**Visuals**). The hitbox of the smaller rats is misleading relative to their size.

## April 25th Second Update

- Removed [**Speed and Movement Rebalanced**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46029) (**Balance**). Personal preference. May make your average movement speed slower if you tend to carry a lot of weight.
- Removed [**Talrivian's State-Based HP Mod**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-90-6521) (**Balance**). Because of how this mod works, Black-Heart Blight can prove devastating to characters (my own character was one-shotted repeatedly just by contracting the disease). It also inflates your HP too much.

## April 25th

- Fixed Weather Adjuster - Sigourn's Mod List json link (**Visuals**). Thanks to ShadowFyre for reporting it.
- Fixed No-Frills Open Vivec information in the loadorder.txt and mods.txt files. Previously they would refer to the non-recommended version, leaving Mod Organizer 2 unable to properly sort the plugin.
- Merged **Equipment** section with **Gameplay** section.

## April 24th

- Finally added Weather Adjuster, and my Weather Adjuster json configuration (**Visuals**).
- Added MGE XE shaders and shader chain instructions (**Mended Morrowind**).

## April 23rd

- Removed [**Better Robes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42773/) (**Visuals**). Personal preference, since the mod is based on Better Bodies assets.
- Removed [**Mages Robes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45739) (**Equipment**). Personal preference, since the mod is based on Better Bodies assets.
- Removed [**Morag Tong Armor**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44938) (**Equipment**). Personal preference, since the mod is based on Better Bodies assets.

## APRIL 21st

- Added Ghostgate Fortress Temple Marker (**Gameplay**).
- Added Religions Elaborated (**Gameplay**).
- Added Temples with Shrines (**Gameplay**).
- Removed [**Intervention Improved**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43267) (**Gameplay**). Personal preference. Replaced with Religions Elaborated, Ghostgate Fortress Temple Marker, and Temples with Shrines.

## APRIL 19th

- Moved Better Robes (**Visuals**).
- Removed [**FMI - Ancient Altar**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47187) (**Internal Logic**). The mod has been hidden from Nexus.
- Removed [**Healers**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47752) (**Internal Logic**). Personal preference. Replaced with Religions Elaborated.
- Removed [**di.Still.ed Lights**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46291) (**Visuals**). Personal preference. While there are bound to be some gameplay issues when a game isn't designed for low visibility (such as shadows not working as the player would expect), there are some lighting issues some players may find untolerable.
- Removed [**Pincushion**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46862) (**Visuals**). The visual effect leads to gameplay dissonance as the player cannot pick up the visible projectiles stuck on fallen enemies or the landscape, whether for their own inventory or to remove them from the game. The projectiles also don't stick to NPC heads.
- Removed [**RainSplash**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43124) (**Visuals**). Personal preference.
- Removed [**Vanilla-Friendly Almalexia Replacer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47068?) (**Visuals**). Personal preference.
- Removed [**Umbra - Blademaster**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43275) (**Gameplay**). Personal preference.
- Removed [**Cloth Helm**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47783) (**Equipment**). Personal preference.
- Removed the **Better Bodies** category. These mods vary in quality and execution, particularly Better Clothes Complete. The only vanilla compatible mod, **Better Robes**, has been kept.
  - [**Better Bodies ZW**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42395)
  - [**Lore-Friendly Better Bodies Underwear**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43065)
  - [**New Beast Bodies by Liztail**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47678)
  - [**Better Clothes Complete**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47549)
  - [**Better Morrowind Armor 2020**](http://www.mediafire.com/file/pffrp899uvuvg34/Better_Morrowind_Armor_2020_v1.0.zip/file)
  - [**Berserkers**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43528)
  - [**Better Dwarven Spectres - Mer and Maidens Edition**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45617)
  - [**Golden Saint Variety**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46430)
