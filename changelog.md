- [Back to main page](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/readme.md)

## May 29th

### Additions

Sigourn's Mod List
- Visuals
  - [**Snow Prince Armor Redux - Icons and Restored Helm Patch**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/85y9f6mzl5q1yni/Snow_Prince_Armor_Redux_-_Icons_and_Restored_Helm_Patch.zip/file): one plugin (replacer).
- Overhauls
  - [**Seven Graces Shrines Enhanced - Simple Golden Gold Patch**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/c62opmbrjgilge6/Seven_Graces_Shrines_Enhanced_-_Simple_Golden_Gold_Patch.zip/file): pluginless.

### Removals

Sigourn's Mod List
- Visuals
  - [**Concept Art Vivec Face Replacement**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46048). Works as advertised, however, it's hardly an "improvement".
  - [**Improved Better Skulls**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46012). Works as advertised, however, I feel it removes the vanilla variety in favor of consistency.
  - [**She Vivec Fixed v1.1**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/00wo4fe37ywj7h5/She_Vivec_Fixed_v1.1_%28Sigourn_Fork%29.zip/file). Works as advertised, however, it can be distracting and could hardly be called an appropiate implementation.
  - [**Temple Waterway v2.0**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-15-15105). Seems to be buggy when using Per Pixel Lighting.

## May 27th

### Maintenance

Sigourn's Mod List
- Load order
  - Updated to reflect new plugin names for Gavrilo93's mods.

## May 25th

### Maintenance

Mending Morrowind
- Optimization
  - Removed Project Atlas instructions for Glow in the Dahrk and Glowing Bitter Coast.

Sigourn's Mod List

  - Added Project Atlas instructions for Glow in the Dahrk and Glowing Bitter Coast.
  - Moved **Concept Art Vivec Face Replacer** to this section.
  - Moved **Creeper the Drummer** to this section.
  - Moved **She Vivec** to this section.
  - Moved **Vanilla Friendly Almalexia Replacer** to this section.

- Visuals
  - [**Mistify**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48112): one plugin.

### Removals

Sigourn's Mod List
- Interal logic
  - **Corsair's MW Inconsistencies**: mod hidden from Nexus.
- Visuals
  - [**Less Fat Adamantium Shortsword**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46488/). Works as advertised, however, it's nowhere near as essential as Improved Nordic Iron Helm Mesh to justify its presence, in my opinion.
- Overhauls
  - [**Dagoth Ur Welcomes You**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44204). Works as advertised, however, I feel it not only breaks character but it also may add some unnecessary goofyness to what's meant to be a serious moment.
  - [**Portrait of Crassius Curio**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42812). Works as advertised, however, I'm not to keen on having such realistic portraits in-game.
  - **Severa Magia DB Fix**: mod hidden from Nexus.
- Gameplay
  - **Realistic Repair Add-On**: mod hidden from Nexus.

## May 23th

### Maintenance

Sigourn's Mod List
- Load order
  - Removed unnecessary load order instructions for **Waterfall Tweaks.esp**. These were a leftover from when I erroneously recommended the Anthology version of No-Frills Open Vivec.

## May 22nd

### Maintenance

Readme
- Fixed broken link for mod order and load order.

Mended Morrowind
- Fixed left-over instructions for Distant Land generation.
- Updated Distant Land generation instructions with Static Overrides.
- Added a note for Steam users under **Official Plugins**.

## May 21st

### Maintenance

Sigourn's Mod List
- Renamed **Quests** to **Quest and faction tweaks**
- Quest and faction tweaks
  - Moved **Ajiras Alchemy Reports** to this section.
  - Moved **Clear Your Name** to this section.
  - Moved **Early Transport to Mournhold** to this section.
  - Moved **FMI - Sane Ordinators** to this section.

  - Moved **Supply Chests Merged** to this section.
  - Moved **What is something that can be perceived with one of your senses of life - Something edgy related to death my brother** to this section.

### Removals

- [**Service Requirements Lore**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45567). Works as advertised. However, the mod locks the Mages Guild's teleportation services to Mages Guild members, and the mod is at serious odds with the game at times. Most importantly, the Mages Guild and House Telvanni monopolize the most important services (Enchanting, Spellmaking, Spells), at which point you are mostly advancing in rank just to get access to Training, allowing you to advance further *even faster* and rendering the entire mod pointless.

### Removals

Sigourn's Mod List

- Audio
  - [**Empty Threats Disabler**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44671). Works as advertised. However, the mod's known glitch (advertised beforehand) makes me remove it.
- Overhauls
  - [**RR Mod Series - Ghostgate Fortress by Resdayn Revival Team**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45822?). Works as advertised. Removed for visual consistency with vanilla Morrowind.
- Game Balance
  - [**Smart Merchants**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47787). Works as advertised. However, it isn't enough to prevent the massive accumulation of cash, and sadly it doesn't solve the problem of gold exploits either.
    - To uninstall this mod, use the Mod Configuration menu found in-game and toggle off the mod's features (Upgrade Trainer NPC Skills; Upgrade Merchant NPC Skills; Tweak also creature prices). Then, save the game, exit, and uninstall the mod.

- **Game balance**
  - Removed [**Talrivian's State-Based HP Mod**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-90-6521). Black-Heart Blight can prove devastating to characters, and the mod also uses a non-vanilla based formula that inflates your HP too much.
- **Mod order and load order**

  - Removed [**RainSplash**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43124). The effect can be very hard to notice if you are not looking.
- **Gameplay**
  - Removed [**Cloth Helm**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47783). The mod doesn't address a perceived flaw in the game's equipment selection, and thus has no place in this mod list.
  - Removed [**Umbra - Blademaster**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43275). Stands out too much from the vanilla game.
