- Added Religions Elaborated (**Gameplay**).
- Added Temples with Shrines (**Gameplay**).

## APRIL 19th

- Moved Better Robes (**Visuals**).
- Removed [**FMI - Ancient Altar**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47187) (**Internal Logic**). The mod has been hidden from Nexus.
- Removed [**Healers**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47752) (**Internal Logic**). Personal preference. Replaced with Religions Elaborated.
- Removed [**di.Still.ed Lights**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46291) (**Visuals**). There are lighting issues that arise from this mod, most notably the pronounced difference between light and shadow which leads to pitch black areas on meshes that shouldn't look like so, on top of the game's dungeons not being designed around such a low light level.
- Removed [**Pincushion**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46862) (**Visuals**). The visual effect leads to gameplay dissonance as the player cannot pick up the visible projectiles stuck on fallen enemies or the landscape, whether for their own inventory or to remove them from the game. The projectiles also don't stick to NPC heads.
- Removed [**RainSplash**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43124) (**Visuals**). Personal preference.
- Removed [**Vanilla-Friendly Almalexia Replacer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47068?) (**Visuals**). Personal preference.
- Removed [**Umbra - Blademaster**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43275) (**Gameplay**). Personal preference.
- Removed [**Cloth Helm**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47783) (**Equipment**). Personal preference.
- Removed the **Better Bodies** category. These mods vary in quality and execution, particularly Better Clothes Complete. The only vanilla compatible mod, **Better Robes**, has been kept.
  - [**Better Bodies ZW**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42395)
  - [**Lore-Friendly Better Bodies Underwear**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43065)
