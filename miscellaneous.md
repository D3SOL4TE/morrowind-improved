- [**Fix those bastard rope fences**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45741) by EJ-12 and Petethegoat: modifies collision boxes on rope-related meshes to prevent getting stuck in them, as well as the player and NPC's hitboxes, making it easier to squeeze past NPCs in tight situations.
- [**GreetDistanceReducer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43994) by helswake: NPCs will not shout at you as often when you walk by. They will still greet you, though, you just have to be a bit closer.

- [**Lower First Person Sneak Mode**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43108) by Androl: lowers the position of the first person camera when sneaking/crouching, making it easier to tell if you are sneaking.
