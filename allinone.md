## CHOOSE YOUR OWN MOD

Choose between one of these two alternatives:

- [**Near Vanilla Road Sign Replacer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44957?) by Atrayonis:  makes road signs legible. Uses vanilla background and resolution.
  - MO2 will install this mod as a BAIN package. Tick the following options and click **OK**:
    - **00 Core**
    - **01 Vvardenfell only**
- [**Signposts Retextured**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42126?) by PeterBitt: makes road signs legible. Uses higher quality vanilla-friendly textures.
  - Install only one of the main files.

## MGE XE MODS

The following mods require specific MGE XE install instructions. Read the mod pages carefully.

- [**di.Still.ed Lights**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46291?) by multiple: removes flicker effect from all light sources except fire flames, rationalizes every light emittance in the game, and darkens interiors.
  - If you dislike the changes made to non-fire sources (like the glowing crystals, glowing lichen, and water) [**install my edited plugin**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/7w7p2r70i0v0kax/di.Still.ed_Lights_v1.0_%28Sigourn_Edit%29.zip/file) instead.
- [**Distant Lights**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42165) by Piratelord: makes lights visible in the distance with MGE XE. Best used with mods that make night dark. See those towns, villages, hamlets, camps from far away.
- [**Distant Mournhold**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43255/?) by EnvyDeveloper: adds distant buildings to Mournhold, so you can see the temple from almost any part of the city.
- [**Remiros' Groundcover**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46733) by Remiros, vtastek, and Hrnchamd: adds groundcover to almost all regions.
- [**Shattered Stones - An Earthquake Mod**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45105) by Greatness7, R-Zero, and vtastek: adds recurring earthquakes to certain volcanically active regions of Vvardenfell. The quakes are implemented strictly for atmospheric purposes and should not directly affect gameplay or conflict with any other mods.
  - I recommend opening up the console in-game and typing **set fQuakeChance to 5** to reduce earthquake chance from 30% to 5%.

# AUDIO

- [**Distant Thunder**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43471) by TheInkBunny: adds a randomized bit of lead time to thunderclaps after lightning strikes for additional realism.
  - Only install the **Distant Thunder v1.1 (No Scripts)** optional file.
  - In MO2, click on the Tools icon, which resembles a jigsaw puzzle, and select INI Editor.
  - On the morrowind.ini that just opened, use CTRL+F to find the following entries and replace them with the data in bold:
    - Thunder Sound ID 0=**Distant_Thunder_00**
    - Thunder Sound ID 1=**Distant_Thunder_01**
    - Thunder Sound ID 2=**Distant_Thunder_02**
    - Thunder Sound ID 3=**Distant_Thunder_03**
- [**Empty Threats Disabler**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44671) by rot: disables attack voices like "You will suffer greatly" on sneak kills or other instant deaths.
- [**Haunted Barrows**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46826) by Melchior Dahrk: gives Nordic barrows on Solstheim their own unique sound. You will hear some deep-voiced chanting and perhaps some drums in the distance if you listen closely enough; hearkening back to ancient battles and burial rites. 
- [**Heartthrum**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47178?) by RedFurryDemon and OperatorJack: allows the player to listen to the Heart of Lorkhan when inside the Ghostfence.
- [**Outdoor Banners With Sound**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47068) by Half11: outdoor banners now play sound alongside their animations. During clear weather types the unused flag.wav sound file is used (it fits this weather type better compared to the standard flag2.wav). For stormy weather types the script uses the regular flag2.wav sound file.
- [**Shut the Fuck up Cliff Racers**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46588) by Merlord: drastically reduces the frequency of idle Cliff Racer screeches, by editing the kf file of the cliff racer mesh.
- [**Silent Assassins**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44371) by R-Zero: Assassin class NPCs will be 10 times less likely to grunt or taunt you in combat, living up to their reputation of being deadly silent killers.
- [**Sound Spell Sound Effect**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43300) by R-Zero: the player will hear an actual noise when he's under the effects of the Sound magic. Its volume depends on the total magnitude of the effect.
- [**Sounds of Souls**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45657?) by NullCascade: soul gems in the world, in the player's inventory, and that the player interacts with will play sounds, corresponding to the creature trapped inside of it.
- [**Store Entrance Chimes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44586) by R-Zero: adds entrance bell chimes with sound effects to imperial town tradehouses and taverns. 
- [**Tunnel Cough**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47603) by R-Zero: makes Miner class NPCs cough.
