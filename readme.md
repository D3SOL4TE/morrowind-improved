## DESCRIPTION

*Morrowind Improved* is the result of years of modding Morrowind: a modding guide that aims to enhance Morrowind across the board but without sacrificing its unique aesthetic.

This mod list is divided in two major sections:

- The [**Setup**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/setup.md) and [**Mending Morrowind**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mendingmw.md) guides, which explain how to install the game, set up tools and mod manager, and patch Morrowind for a mostly bug-free, stable, and purist Morrowind experience.
- The [**Modding Morrowind**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/modlist.md) and [**Tools**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mwtools.md) guides, which explain how to install many mods that enhance Morrowind, and how to solve potential issues with said mods.

While the **Setup** and **Mending Morrowind** are meant for everyone who is looking into playing Morrowind, the **Modding Morrowind** and **Tools** guides are aimed at more experienced modders. The **Modding Morrowind** guide, in particular, is divided into a series of modules, all of which can be installed independently from one another.

All mods present in Morrowind Improved will have a brief description on what they do, as well as the appropiate link to their mod pages (almost always on Nexus, rarely on Morrowind Modding History, and under very specific circumstances on my personal MediaFire).

My mod manager of choice for Morrowind is **Mod Organizer 2**. The **Setup** module will explain in detail why I use it, and how to use it. Last but not least: when installing mods, conflicts are bound to appear sooner or later. This mod list has been curated to keep those to a minimum. Specific instructions will be provided in order to solve mod conflicts, but rest assured that an appropiate load order, as well as the use of **TES3Merge** (which you will learn how to install and use in the **Tools** module) is enough to solve 99% of them.

## MOD ORDER AND LOAD ORDER

My mod list uses a working mod installation order and plugin load order that guarantees conflicts will be kept to the bare minimum. You can download a package containing these in .txt form from here: [**Morrowind Improved June 16th**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vlolmWyVhegQr8NDKB88EXChx2j0NdGn/view?usp=sharing)

The **loadorder.txt** is formatted so that Mod Organizer 2 is able to read it, and adjust your load order accordingly. For Mod Organizer 2 to recognize **loadorder.txt**, you need to place it inside **\Mod Organizer 2\profiles\Default\loadorder.txt**, overwriting when appropriate. Note that "Default" is the default generic profile name: you must place the .txt file in your corresponding profile folder. 
- If you use a different mod manager or don't feel like overwriting your personal **loadorder.txt**, you will have to adjust your load order manually. Simply follow the plugin order listed in **loadorder.txt**.
- Your mod installation order *has* to be adjusted manually, regardless of which mod manager you use.

More information on the difference between "mod order" and "load order" can be found in **Mended Morrowind**.
