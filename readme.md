Sigourn's Mod List is just that, a list of Morrowind mods I use and recommend. In spite of its size, with over 200 mods, it is a mod list that is actually fairly lightweight in what it adds and changes from the game. 

Many of these mods are so minor that most people wouldn't even think of installing them. Almost all of them are very well integrated into the game to the point the only clue someone may have they have installed a mod is the very act of doing so, and the existence of an in-game mod configuration menu. Mods that function correctly and without annoying issues were a priority for this mod list.

Notable mod categories which are absent from this list are:

- Visual upgrades that aren't suggested because of internal consistency or because they add something to the game.
- Player homes.
- Quest tweaks, new quests, new factions, etc.

## INDEX

- [**Mended Morrowind**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mendedmw.md): a basic mod list for a (mostly) bug-free and stable Morrowind experience.
- [**Tools**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mwtools.md): a small guide to get you up to speed on the basic but essential functions of different modding tools, including compatibility visualization, conflict solving, and mod cleaning.
- [**User Interface**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/userinterface.md): mods that improve on the functionality of the user interface.
- [**Content Restoration**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/contentrestoration.md): mods that restore content cut from the final release of the game.
- [**Internal Logic**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/internallogic.md): mods that improve on deficient aspects of the game's lore and overall internal logic or consistency.
- [**Visuals**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/visuals.md): mods that improve on the visual aspects of the game, either by tweaking existing textures and meshes, adding new ones, or adding new effects.
- [**Audio**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/audio.md): mods that improve on the game's audio design, by adding new sound effects or tweaking existing sounds.
- [**Miscellaneous**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/miscellaneous.md): mods I didn't know where else to fit, but which are great mods on their own anyhow.
- [**Overhauls**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/overhauls.md): mods that make significant changes to locations, including dungeons, towns, and villages, and don't limit themselves to retextures or minor additions.
- [**Gameplay**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/gameplay.md): mods that modify how the game plays like, from small tweaks, quality of life improvements, minor radiant quest additions, or mechanical tweaks.

### BASIC INSTALLATION PROCEDURES

Every module listed above can be installed independently from each other. All modules, however, will provide specific install instructions for compatibility with the other mods (like installing compatibility patches). These, however, are very obvious and I leave it to your judgement to know when you should or shouldn't install a certain compatibility patch.

You will also notice many times I leave no installation instructions whatsoever. This means two things:

1. That you should only install the main file (if the mod is hosted on Nexus).
2. That the installation is straightforward.

Last but not least: these modules are meant to be installed in that order. I've listed the mods in alphabetical order within each module, but specific instructions may be present below under **CONFLICT NOTES** when the default alphabetical installation order may mess with some mods.

## A WORD OF ADVICE

Every single mod present in this guide is a mod I use or, in very few exceptions, a mod that is an alternative to a mod I'm using. Absent from this guide are mods I do not use, for a simple reason: if I'm not using it, it is because...

- I do not think it is a good mod.
- I think it is a good mod, but with flaws that stop me from using it.
- I'm not interested in said mod.
- I haven't gotten to play with it yet because it drastically modifies aspects of the game (the world, the factions, the quests) that I've yet to experience as the devs intended.
- I'm not aware of said mod's existence. This only applies for "obscure" mods, as all the popular ones are covered by the four exceptions mentioned above.

I want to make this clear from the start because no doubt some people will wonder why "X" mod which is very popular was not included in the guide.

The good news is that because I use every single mod in this list (minor conflicting alternatives) I have a good idea of the level of compatibility between the mods listed here. As such, I can tell you the conflicts are kept to a minimum, to ensure the appropriate enjoyment of each of the mods present here.

The bad news is that because of the complexity of the guide, some modding experience is required. People with modding experience in future Bethesda titles will feel right at home and should have no issues whatsoever. People with no modding experience, I suggest you read the mods' descriptions and installation instructions before installing them in your game.
