## DESCRIPTION

*Morrowind Improved* is nothing else than the Morrowind mods I play with and can recommend to anyone. It's the result of years of modding Morrowind, which include many many popular modding guides that have all contributed, in one way or another, to the development of this mod list.

This mod list is divided in a serious of modules for your convenience. All modules can be installed independently from one another. All mods will have a brief description on what they do, as well as the appropiate link to their mod pages (almost always on Nexus, rarely on Morrowind Modding History, and under very specific circumstances on my personal MediaFire).

For the most part, I will provide no installation instructions whatsoever. This means two things:

1. That you should only install the main file (if the mod in question is hosted on Nexus; MMH and MediaFire are single-link downloads).
2. That the installation is straightforward, and requires no special instructions.

My mod manager of choice for Morrowind is **Mod Organizer 2**. The **Setup** module will explain in detail why I use it, and how to use it. Last but not least: when installing mods, conflicts are bound to appear sooner or later. This mod list has been curated to keep those to a minimum. Specific instructions will be provided in order to solve mod conflicts, but rest assured that an appropiate load order, as well as the use of **TES3Merge** (which you will learn how to install and use in the **Tools** module) is enough to solve 99% of them.

## INSTALLATION INDEX

- [**Setup**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/setup.md): a guide to help you set up Morrowind, tools and mod manager from scratch.
- [**Mending Morrowind**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mendingmw.md): a small guide for a (mostly) bug-free, stable, and purist Morrowind experience.
- [**Morrowind Improved**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/modlist.md): this guide aims to fix many issues with Morrowind as a whole, beyond simple bug fixes: improving the user interface, reinforcing the internal consistency of the game, quality of life visual, sound, and gameplay improvements, and providing a more balanced gameplay experience.
- [**Tools**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mwtools.md): a small guide to get you up to speed on the basic but essential functions of different modding tools, including compatibility visualization, conflict solving, and mod cleaning.

## MOD ORDER AND LOAD ORDER

My mod list uses a working mod installation order and plugin load order that guarantees conflicts will be kept to the bare minimum. You can download a package containing these in .txt form from here: [**Morrowind Improved June 16th**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vlolmWyVhegQr8NDKB88EXChx2j0NdGn/view?usp=sharing)

The **loadorder.txt** is formatted so that Mod Organizer 2 is able to read it, and adjust your load order accordingly. For Mod Organizer 2 to recognize **loadorder.txt**, you need to place it inside **\Mod Organizer 2\profiles\Default\loadorder.txt**, overwriting when appropriate. Note that "Default" is the default generic profile name: you must place the .txt file in your corresponding profile folder. 
- If you use a different mod manager or don't feel like overwriting your personal **loadorder.txt**, you will have to adjust your load order manually. Simply follow the plugin order listed in **loadorder.txt**.
- Your mod installation order *has* to be adjusted manually, regardless of which mod manager you use.

More information on the difference between "mod order" and "load order" can be found in **Mended Morrowind**.
