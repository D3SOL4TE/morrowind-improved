Sigourn's Mod List is just that, a list of Morrowind mods I use and recommend. In spite of its size, with over 200 mods, it is a mod list that is actually fairly lightweight in what it adds and changes from the game. 

Many of these mods are so minor that most people wouldn't even think of installing them. Almost all of them are very well integrated into the game to the point the only clue someone may have they have installed a mod is the very act of doing so, and the existence of an in-game mod configuration menu. Mods that function correctly and without annoying issues were a priority for this mod list.

Notable mod categories which are absent from this list are:

- Visual upgrades that aren't suggested because of internal consistency or because they add something to the game.
- Player homes.
- Quest tweaks, new quests, new factions, etc.

## INDEX

- [**Mended Morrowind**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mendedmw.md): a basic mod list for a (mostly) bug-free and stable Morrowind experience.
- [**Tools**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mwtools.md): a small guide to get you up to speed on the basic but essential functions of different modding tools, including compatibility visualization, conflict solving, and mod cleaning.
- [**User Interface**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/userinterface.md): mods that improve on the functionality of the user interface.
- [**Content Restoration**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/contentrestoration.md): mods that restore content cut from the final release of the game.
- [**Internal Logic**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/internallogic.md): mods that improve on deficient aspects of the game's lore and overall internal logic or consistency.
- [**Visuals**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/visuals.md): mods that improve on the visual aspects of the game, either by tweaking existing textures and meshes, adding new ones, or adding new effects.
- [**Audio**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/audio.md): mods that improve on the game's audio design, by adding new sound effects or tweaking existing sounds.
- [**Miscellaneous**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/miscellaneous.md): mods I didn't know where else to fit, but which are great mods on their own anyhow.
- [**Overhauls**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/overhauls.md): mods that make significant changes to locations, including dungeons, towns, and villages, and don't limit themselves to retextures or minor additions.
- [**Gameplay**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/gameplay.md): mods that modify how the game plays like, from small tweaks, quality of life improvements, minor radiant quest additions, or mechanical tweaks.

- [**Equipment**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/equipment.md): mods that add new pieces of equipment to the game.

### BASIC INSTALLATION PROCEDURES

Every module listed above can be installed independently from each other. All modules, however, will provide specific install instructions for compatibility with the other mods (like installing compatibility patches). These, however, are very obvious and I leave it to your judgement to know when you should or shouldn't install a certain compatibility patch.

You will also notice many times I leave no installation instructions whatsoever. This means two things:
1. That you should only install the main file (if the mod is hosted on Nexus).
2. That the installation is straightforward.

### MOD ORDER AND LOAD ORDER

Since you will be (potentially) installing hundreds of mods and hundreds of plugins, I saw fit to provide a working mod installation order and plugin load order.

[**Download these files here.**](http://www.mediafire.com/file/0qu9rlgyjlwe76w/Sigourn%2527s_Mod_List.zip/file)

The gist of this is simple:
- The **Mod installation order.txt** shows the proper installation order of all mods. In Mod Organizer 2, your mod installation order is found in the left window. There you can move mods around, changing their installation order.
- The **loadorder.txt** is a Mod Organizer 2-ready text file that will automatically sort your installed mods following that specific load order (which contains *all* plugins present in the mod list above). In Mod Organizer 2, your plugin load order is found in the right window. There you can move plugins around, changing their load order. 

For Mod Organizer 2 to recognize **loadorder.txt**, you need to place it inside **\Mod Organizer 2\profiles\Default\loadorder.txt**, overwriting when appropriate. Note that "Default" is the default generic profile name: you must place the .txt file in your corresponding profile folder. As you install more and more mods from this mod list, you will want to regularly replace your existent loadorder.txt from the one download above. This will update your load order as you get closer to the end of this guide.

Note that you don't *have* to replace your **loadorder.txt** if you don't want to. Simply match your load order as closely as possible to that of the one present in the text file.

Sadly, it is near impossible to provide a functional **modlist.txt**, as I tend to rename downloaded archives for clarity. But simply follow **Mod installation order.txt** and you will be fine. I recommend following my mod list in order to minimize the amount of mods you will have to rearrange in your Mod Organizer 2 left window.

## A WORD OF ADVICE

Every single mod present in this guide is a mod I use or, in very few exceptions, a mod that is an alternative to a mod I'm using. Absent from this guide are mods I do not use, for a simple reason: if I'm not using it, it is because...

- I do not think it is a good mod.
- I think it is a good mod, but with flaws that stop me from using it.
- I'm not interested in said mod.
- I haven't gotten to play with it yet because it drastically modifies aspects of the game (the world, the factions, the quests) that I've yet to experience as the devs intended.
- I'm not aware of said mod's existence. This only applies for "obscure" mods, as all the popular ones are covered by the four exceptions mentioned above.

I want to make this clear from the start because no doubt some people will wonder why "X" mod which is very popular was not included in the guide.

The good news is that because I use every single mod in this list (minor conflicting alternatives) I have a good idea of the level of compatibility between the mods listed here. As such, I can tell you the conflicts are kept to a minimum, to ensure the appropriate enjoyment of each of the mods present here.

The bad news is that because of the complexity of the guide, some modding experience is required. People with modding experience in future Bethesda titles will feel right at home and should have no issues whatsoever. People with no modding experience, I suggest you read the mods' descriptions and installation instructions before installing them in your game.
